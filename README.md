## Overview

### The challenge

### Introduction- Traffic light system

Develop a system for traffic passing through a 4-way intersection, controlled by traffic light. We
will assume that arrangement of traffic lights and road lanes is fixed and that the lights switch
from red to green to yellow in a regular repetitive pattern.

---

Terms:
One Cycle = 10seconds
Half Cycle = 5seconds

---

### Task Description and Acceptance Criteria

• When the light is GREEN on Street A, give Street B a RED light for One Cycle.
• After the One Cycle give both Street A and B a yellow light for Half Cycle to show ready
to move.
• After the Half Cycle give Street A a RED light to stop and give Street B the GREEN light
to move for One Cycle.
• and Vice versa
• When you press the reset button, the light should be initially GREEN on A Street and
RED on B Street.
